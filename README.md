# tsoa-htmx-demo

Demonstration project for using a mixture of [Bun](https://bun.sh), [TSOA](https://tsoa-community.github.io/docs/getting-started.html) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) for building a Web UI. We additionally use [@kitajs/html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kitajs/html) for enabling JSX templating in views.

## Setup

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

And then to building the `tsoa` routes:

```bash
bun run build
```

Finally to run:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts
```

## Tests

Tests can be run with

```bash
bun test
```
