# tsoa-htmx-demo

Demonstration project for using a mixture of [TSOA](https://tsoa-community.github.io/docs/getting-started.html) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) for building a Web UI. We additionally use [@kitajs/html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kitajs/html) for enabling JSX templating in views.
